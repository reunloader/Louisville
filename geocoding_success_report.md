## Recommendations

### To Improve Success Rate:

1. **Location qualifiers**: Consider pre-processing addresses to remove 'near' and 'at' phrases
2. **Intersections**: Review intersection parsing logic and try alternative formats
3. **Extra context**: Improve cleaning logic to remove sentences after the address
4. **Incomplete addresses**: Review extraction patterns to capture more complete addresses
