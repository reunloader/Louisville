Here's a look at the notable calls our first responders have been handling over the last few hours. We are monitoring the feeds and will provide a full analytical digest of the day's events later tonight.

🔊 **Residential Fire Alarm** – 1400 block of Clare Ln – around 5:56 a.m.

Engine 18 and Truck 8 were dispatched to a home on Clare Ln due to a fire alarm. The alarm was reportedly a possible gas alarm that had been sounding for approximately ten minutes. After a thorough check of the area, no problems were discovered. Both responding units were then cleared and returned to service.

We will post our full 24-hour summary at the end of the day. Look out for one another. -Derby City Watch.
