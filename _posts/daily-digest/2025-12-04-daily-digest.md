### 💬 How You Can Help

With multiple reports of suspicious activity and individuals, it's important for residents to remain vigilant and report anything out of the ordinary to the authorities. If you witness suspicious behavior or vehicles, please note any distinguishing details and contact the non-emergency police line or 911 if the situation appears immediately dangerous. In cases of disturbances or loud noises, prioritize your safety by staying indoors and calling for assistance rather than confronting individuals directly.
