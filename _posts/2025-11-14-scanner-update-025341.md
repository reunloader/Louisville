Here's a look at the notable calls our first responders have been handling over the last few hours. We are monitoring the feeds and will provide a full analytical digest of the day's events later tonight.

🚔 **Jail Operations** – Downtown Area – around 2:17 a.m.

Police units were initially sent to the jail but were later told to disregard the call. Officers were then instructed to stand by for more information regarding stolen vehicles and individuals needing to be brought to the jail. The exact details of the vehicles and the individuals were not specified in the dispatch.

We will post our full 24-hour summary at the end of the day. Look out for one another. -Derby City Watch.
