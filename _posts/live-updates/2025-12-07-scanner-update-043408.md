Here's a look at the notable calls our first responders have been handling over the last few hours. We are monitoring the feeds and will provide a full analytical digest of the day's events later tonight.

👤 **Welfare Check / Disturbance** – Domino's on Dixie Hwy – around 3:48 a.m.

Officers responded to a report of a disturbance at a local business. The situation involved an individual with a history of concerning behavior, including past weapons possession and paranoia. Authorities conducted a preliminary assessment to ensure public safety, observing the individual's residence from a distance to confirm no immediate threats were present. The decision was made to resolve the call without direct contact, given the individual was alone and the situation appeared contained.

We will post our full 24-hour summary at the end of the day. Look out for one another. -Derby City Watch.
