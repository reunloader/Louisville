Here's a look at the notable calls our first responders have been handling over the last few hours. We are monitoring the feeds and will provide a full analytical digest of the day's events later tonight.

🔥 **Structure Fire** – 1000 block of West Broadway near 13th Street – around 5:27 a.m.

Fire units were dispatched to a report of a fire in the 1000 block of West Broadway. Upon arrival, crews observed smoke and directed streams of water towards a dormer on the roofline. A hole in the roof required specific positioning of water streams to effectively combat the blaze. Some units remained on scene for fire watch after the main incident was controlled.

We will post our full 24-hour summary at the end of the day. Look out for one another. -Derby City Watch.
