Here's a look at the notable calls our first responders have been handling over the last few hours. We are monitoring the feeds and will provide a full analytical digest of the day's events later tonight.

🔊 **Commercial Alarm** – 9400 block of Bonson Parkway – around 2:51 p.m.

A fire alarm was activated at a commercial building. Responding units investigated the situation thoroughly. They determined that the alarm was triggered by a panel within a side business and that there was no actual fire. All units were cleared from the scene and returned to their regular duties.

We will post our full 24-hour summary at the end of the day. Look out for one another. -Derby City Watch.
