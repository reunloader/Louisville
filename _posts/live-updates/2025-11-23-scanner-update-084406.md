Here's a look at the notable calls our first responders have been handling over the last few hours. We are monitoring the feeds and will provide a full analytical digest of the day's events later tonight.

🏥 **Medical Emergency** – North Heights Avenue – around 8:07 a.m.

Emergency crews were dispatched to a report of a possible stabbing involving a 44-year-old male. Firefighters staged nearby before proceeding to the location, and police were requested to provide support at the scene.

🔥 **Illegal Burn** – 1900 block of Lewiston – around 8:06 a.m.

Fire units were sent to investigate an illegal burn at a property. The homeowner had already put out the fire by the time the units arrived, so they were able to return to service without further action.

We will post our full 24-hour summary at the end of the day. Look out for one another. -Derby City Watch.
