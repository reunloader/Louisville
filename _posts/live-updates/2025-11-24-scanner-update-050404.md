Here's a look at the notable calls our first responders have been handling over the last few hours. We are monitoring the feeds and will provide a full analytical digest of the day's events later tonight.

🚑 **Medical Assist** – I-64 Eastbound on-ramp from 19B – around 4:26 a.m.

A vehicle was discovered stopped in the middle of an on-ramp, prompting a response. The driver, a male appearing to be in his late 30s or 40s, was found unresponsive in the driver's seat. EMS arrived and assessed the individual, who was found to be conscious, breathing, and alert.

We will post our full 24-hour summary at the end of the day. Look out for one another. -Derby City Watch.
