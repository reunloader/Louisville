Here's a look at the notable calls our first responders have been handling over the last few hours. We are monitoring the feeds and will provide a full analytical digest of the day's events later tonight.

🔥 **Structure Fire** – 1800 block of Frankfort Ave – around 7:57 p.m.

Multiple fire units, including Tower 2 and Battalion 2, were dispatched to a fire reported to be originating from a deck port. Initial reports indicated no visible fire upon arrival, but this was later corrected. The incident was located at a three-story wood structure and was managed effectively by Tower 2, with other responding units being released from service.

🚗 **Traffic Congestion** – 6500 block of Frankfort Ave – around 8:15 p.m.

A report indicated significant traffic gridlock on Frankfort Ave. This congestion was directly related to the earlier structure fire response in the area. The individual reporting the traffic stated they would be available for service once the flow of vehicles began to move again.

We will post our full 24-hour summary at the end of the day. Look out for one another. -Derby City Watch.
