Here's a look at the notable calls our first responders have been handling over the last few hours. We are monitoring the feeds and will provide a full analytical digest of the day's events later tonight.

🚨 **Vehicle Pursuit** – Danzig and 64 West at the county line – around 1:17 a.m.

Deputies from Madison County initiated a pursuit of a white truck, which was noted to have no identifying marks or license plates. The pursuit continued towards downtown Louisville, with the vehicle traveling at speeds around 40 miles per hour. Reports indicate the truck struck multiple police cruisers and other vehicles during the chase. Shelby County authorities upgraded the charges to attempted murder of officers due to the dangerous nature of the pursuit. Air support was requested by Madison County to assist in tracking the vehicle.

We will post our full 24-hour summary at the end of the day. Look out for one another. -Derby City Watch.
