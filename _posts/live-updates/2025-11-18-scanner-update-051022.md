Here's a look at the notable calls our first responders have been handling over the last few hours. We are monitoring the feeds and will provide a full analytical digest of the day's events later tonight.

🚨 **Vehicle Pursuit** – 41st Street and Broadway – around 4:21 a.m.

A vehicle, described as a charger, was reported as stolen or involved in a pursuit. It was last observed traveling northbound on 41st Street at Broadway. Authorities noted the vehicle was moving at a high rate of speed, making it difficult for Flock cameras to capture identifying information.

🚨 **Vehicle Pursuit** – Greenwood Rd and Terry Rd – around 4:21 a.m.

Another report indicated a charger vehicle was either stolen or part of a pursuit, this time heading eastbound on Greenwood from Terry Rd. Similar to the other incident, the vehicle's speed prevented Flock cameras from obtaining a clear license plate identification.

🚔 **Traffic Stop** – 2700 block of Taylorsville Rd – around 4:21 a.m.

Police units conducted a traffic stop for a violation in the 2700 block of Taylorsville Rd. The incident was reported as resolved, with officers clearing the scene.

We will post our full 24-hour summary at the end of the day. Look out for one another. -Derby City Watch.
