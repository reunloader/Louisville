Here's a look at the notable calls our first responders have been handling over the last few hours. We are monitoring the feeds and will provide a full analytical digest of the day's events later tonight.

🚔 **Traffic Stop** – Preston Hwy and Bardstown Rd – around 4:38 a.m.

A routine traffic stop led to the discovery that the driver's license was no longer valid. Police units were en route to the jail with one individual in custody. The vehicle itself was found to be clear of any issues, and another person remained with the car but was not being detained.

We will post our full 24-hour summary at the end of the day. Look out for one another. -Derby City Watch.
