Here's a look at the notable calls our first responders have been handling over the last few hours. We are monitoring the feeds and will provide a full analytical digest of the day's events later tonight.

🏥 **Medical Emergency** – 6200 block of Walnut Ridge – around 6:11 a.m.

EMS responded to a call in the 6200 block of Walnut Ridge. They were on the scene and available to assist. The incident was resolved and EMS was back in service shortly after their arrival.

🏥 **Medical Assist** – 700 block of Southbrook Street – around 6:12 a.m.

First responders were dispatched to the Salvation Army Center of Hope in the 700 block of Southbrook Street. The call was for a 74-year-old male who was experiencing vomiting. While police were initially requested due to concerns about alcohol consumption, their presence was ultimately not needed as EMS was already attending to the patient.

We will post our full 24-hour summary at the end of the day. Look out for one another. -Derby City Watch.
