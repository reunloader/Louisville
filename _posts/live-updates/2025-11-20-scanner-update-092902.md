Here's a look at the notable calls our first responders have been handling over the last few hours. We are monitoring the feeds and will provide a full analytical digest of the day's events later tonight.

🔥 **Commercial Fire Alarm** – 400 block of E W Muhammad Ali Blvd – around 9:01 a.m.

A fire alarm was triggered by the presence of smoke in a tall building. Fire units were dispatched to the location and confirmed the alarm. They also took action to secure the fire department connection. After the situation was resolved, the alarm system was reset, and the responding units returned to service.

We will post our full 24-hour summary at the end of the day. Look out for one another. -Derby City Watch.
