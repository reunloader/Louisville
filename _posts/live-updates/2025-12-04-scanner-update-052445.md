Here's a look at the notable calls our first responders have been handling over the last few hours. We are monitoring the feeds and will provide a full analytical digest of the day's events later tonight.

👤 **Welfare Check / Animal Welfare** – 200 block of Landing Dr – around 4:42 a.m.

A request was made for a welfare check on a dog that had reportedly been chained outside for more than a day. Animal Services was notified and indicated they would respond later in the morning. The officer on scene was advised to contact the person who made the report to update them on the situation. The call was resolved with a warning issued.

We will post our full 24-hour summary at the end of the day. Look out for one another. -Derby City Watch.
