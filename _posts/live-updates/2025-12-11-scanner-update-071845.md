Here's a look at the notable calls our first responders have been handling over the last few hours. We are monitoring the feeds and will provide a full analytical digest of the day's events later tonight.

🚗 **Routine Traffic or Chatter** – local streets and community areas – around 6:00 a.m.

It's been a relatively quiet period with mostly routine traffic and medical assists. There have been no significant incidents reported during this morning window, allowing emergency services to focus on everyday safety and community presence. We will post our full 24-hour summary at the end of the day. Look out for one another. -Derby City Watch.
