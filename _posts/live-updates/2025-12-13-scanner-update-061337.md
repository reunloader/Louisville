A woman described as a small-built black female with no shirt and no shoes approached a resident’s door claiming she had been jumped. She remained on the porch when officers arrived and was provided with a shirt for modesty. Officers checked her welfare but did not find any immediate danger. The incident appeared to be a distress call, and officers offered assistance and reassurance.

🏠 **Welfare Check** – 300 block of North 27th Street – around 5:29 a.m.

Officers were asked to verify the safety of a woman named Kalisha, who was reportedly expected at that location by her mother.

It’s been a relatively quiet period with mostly routine traffic and medical assists.
