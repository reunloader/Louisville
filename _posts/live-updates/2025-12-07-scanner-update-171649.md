Here's a look at the notable calls our first responders have been handling over the last few hours. We are monitoring the feeds and will provide a full analytical digest of the day's events later tonight.

👤 **Welfare Check / Suspicious Address** – Delaware Dr – around 4:37 p.m.

A deputy was sent to check on someone at a Delaware Dr address, but the initial location provided by dispatch was incorrect. After confirming the first address was not valid, dispatch provided a new address on Delaware Dr, which also turned out to be invalid. A third address on Monticello Ave was then suggested. The deputy concluded their investigation and cleared the scene shortly after.

We will post our full 24-hour summary at the end of the day. Look out for one another. -Derby City Watch.
