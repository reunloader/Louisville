Here's a look at the notable calls our first responders have been handling over the last few hours. We are monitoring the feeds and will provide a full analytical digest of the day's events later tonight.

🔊 **Commercial Alarm** – Tyler's Hill Rd. – around 8:28 p.m.

A commercial alarm was activated at a single-story commercial building. Responding units arrived on scene and determined the alarm was a false activation, often referred to as "for show." No further action was required.

We will post our full 24-hour summary at the end of the day. Look out for one another. -Derby City Watch.
