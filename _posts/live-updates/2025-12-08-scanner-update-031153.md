Here's a look at the notable calls our first responders have been handling over the last few hours. We are monitoring the feeds and will provide a full analytical digest of the day's events later tonight.

🔥 **Structure Fire** – 231 – around 2:28 a.m.

Firefighters were dispatched to a structure fire where flames were visible at the peak of the building on the Charlie side, as well as in the Charlie Delta quarter near the chimney. Crews worked diligently to extinguish the blaze, with some fire remaining in the Charlie Delta quarter. The primary fire building and the Delta exposure were brought under control. Operations then focused on the Bravo exposure, and the fire was eventually reported as knocked down with all visible flames extinguished on the Bravo exposure.

We will post our full 24-hour summary at the end of the day. Look out for one another. -Derby City Watch.
