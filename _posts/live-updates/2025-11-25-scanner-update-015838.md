Here's a look at the notable calls our first responders have been handling over the last few hours. We are monitoring the feeds and will provide a full analytical digest of the day's events later tonight.

👤 **Welfare Check** – Bardstown Rd and Taylorsville Rd – around 1:35 a.m.

Respondents requested assistance to check on an individual's well-being. Police units were dispatched to the location and worked to establish contact. The specific outcome of the welfare check was not immediately available.

We will post our full 24-hour summary at the end of the day. Look out for one another. -Derby City Watch.
