🚑 **Medical Emergency** – 27th Street near W Muhammad Ali Blvd – around 2:22 a.m.

Responding to a report of a 52-year-old male who was found with a short of ear and was not alert. Emergency units arrived to assess the individual, but the call was ultimately canceled before further intervention. The situation was quickly resolved, and no additional assistance was needed at this time.

🔥 **Fire Alarm** – Dutchman Parkway near Extended Stay – around 2:21 a.m.

An auto fire alarm was triggered at a building on Dutchman Parkway, prompting a partial evacuation of the premises. Fire alarm units responded promptly and are currently standing by to monitor the system, which appears to be a false alarm or system issue. No fire or injuries were reported.

🚓 **Traffic Stop** – 3500 block of Lodge Ln – around 2:18 a.m.

A vehicle stop was conducted on Lodge Ln involving a purple Lincoln MKC with no visible tag. Multiple police units assisted in the traffic stop, which resulted in the vehicle being cleared and traffic resuming normally. No further incidents occurred during this stop.
