Responders were dispatched to a report of a possible gas leak outside in the area. A suspect was observed with a gas odor near an outdoor meter, prompting a response from fire units. Fortunately, no abnormal gas readings were detected, and the situation was contained without incident.

🏥 **Medical Emergency** – East 1-3 Avenue – around 8:42 p.m.

Emergency personnel assisted with a medical call involving two individuals who were conscious and breathing but acting strangely, possibly due to substance use. The individuals appeared disoriented and unalert, requiring medical evaluation and support from EMS. The situation was stabilized on scene, and the individuals received appropriate care.
