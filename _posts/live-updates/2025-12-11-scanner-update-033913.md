Here's a look at the notable calls our first responders have been handling over the last few hours. We are monitoring the feeds and will provide a full analytical digest of the day's events later tonight.

🚓 **Welfare Check** – 2500 block of Terra Crossing Blvd – around 2:46 a.m.

Officers responded to reports of a male who appeared mentally unstable and matched a suspect description. The individual was found at the door of a residence, prompting police to locate him for safety reasons. Multiple police units arrived on scene to assess the situation and ensure the individual's well-being. The situation was resolved without incident, and units cleared shortly after.

We will post our full 24-hour summary at the end of the day. Look out for one another. -Derby City Watch.
