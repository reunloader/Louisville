Here's a look at the notable calls our first responders have been handling over the last few hours. We are monitoring the feeds and will provide a full analytical digest of the day's events later tonight.

🔊 **Commercial Alarm** – 300 block of W W Brandeis Ave – around 6:14 a.m.

Fire units were dispatched to a commercial alarm at the Louisville Hall dormitory. The alarm was located near 4th Street. Upon arrival, responders observed no signs of smoke or fire emanating from the multi-story building. The fire department connection was utilized, and it was determined that the alarm was false. The responding units were then cleared and returned to service.

👤 **Welfare Check** – Jail – around 5:59 a.m.

Police officers were attempting to make contact with an individual who was reportedly being held at the jail. However, the jail confirmed that the person in question was not in their custody. Another unit was monitoring a separate channel and was contacted to communicate with the reporting unit. Information was relayed, and a callback number was provided by the jail's command officer.

We will post our full 24-hour summary at the end of the day. Look out for one another. -Derby City Watch.
