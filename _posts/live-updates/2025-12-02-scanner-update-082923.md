Here's a look at the notable calls our first responders have been handling over the last few hours. We are monitoring the feeds and will provide a full analytical digest of the day's events later tonight.

🚗 **Vehicle Assist/Stuck Vehicles** – Interstate 64 East near I-264 – around 7:50 a.m.

A deputy observed one vehicle that had become disabled, with an additional five vehicles stuck in the vicinity. Some motorists had reportedly left their vehicles in the roadway, creating a hazard. The deputy was unable to provide further assistance and had to leave the scene.

We will post our full 24-hour summary at the end of the day. Look out for one another. -Derby City Watch.
