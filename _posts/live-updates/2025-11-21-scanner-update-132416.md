Here's a look at the notable calls our first responders have been handling over the last few hours. We are monitoring the feeds and will provide a full analytical digest of the day's events later tonight.

👤 **Eviction / Show Cause Notice** – Downtown Area – around 12:47 p.m.

Officers were dispatched to a call regarding an eviction. Upon arrival, the situation was resolved as the individual involved had already vacated the premises. Additionally, a show cause notice was being addressed, and an officer proceeded upstairs to personally handle the matter.

We will post our full 24-hour summary at the end of the day. Look out for one another. -Derby City Watch.
