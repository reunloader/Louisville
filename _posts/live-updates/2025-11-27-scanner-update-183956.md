Here's a look at the notable calls our first responders have been handling over the last few hours. We are monitoring the feeds and will provide a full analytical digest of the day's events later tonight.

🔥 **Fire Department Operations** – Downtown Area – around 6:00 p.m.

A fire department crew member was reported to be riding with EMS and was subsequently cleared of a run. They then mixed out of service before returning to active duty. Another unit reported being canceled by EMS and was subsequently marked as available.


🚔 **Law Enforcement Operations** – Downtown Area – around 5:57 p.m.

A request was made to check with Metro Safe regarding a served MIW (Missing/Injured Warrant) on a juvenile by LMPD. The dispatcher was uncertain if the warrant had been served, noting it was sent to the 3rd and 7th Divisions. Efforts to contact the MIW office were unsuccessful.

Following up on the previous call, a unit contacted the NCIC office at Metro Safe. They confirmed they had no further involvement after forwarding information to the 3rd Division. The unit expressed gratitude for the assistance provided.

We will post our full 24-hour summary at the end of the day. Look out for one another. -Derby City Watch.
