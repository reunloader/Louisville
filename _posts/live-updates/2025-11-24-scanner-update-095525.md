Here's a look at the notable calls our first responders have been handling over the last few hours. We are monitoring the feeds and will provide a full analytical digest of the day's events later tonight.

🔥 **Public Works/LG&E Incident** – 500 block of South 3rd Street – around 9:07 a.m.

A large tree fell onto a power line, necessitating a response from LG&E and Public Works. Public Works indicated they would not proceed until LG&E had addressed the immediate power line hazard. Fire units were involved in the initial response to the scene.

🔊 **Commercial Alarm** – 500 block of South 3rd Street – around 9:07 a.m.

A commercial alarm was activated at a high-rise residential building. Responding fire units observed no visible signs of trouble from the exterior. The alarm system could not be reset due to water flow, and the incident was cleared shortly after.

🏥 **Medical Emergency/Possible Fight** – I-200 block Westbound at the 15-mile marker – around 9:25 a.m.

Reports indicated a possible fight or medical emergency on the interstate, with a black sedan pulled over. Witnesses described one male on the ground with another straddling him, unsure if it was an altercation or a medical situation. Police units were dispatched to investigate the incident, which was later determined to be closer to the airport in the eastbound lanes.

🏠 **Domestic Disturbance** – Location not specified – around 9:30 a.m.

A domestic disturbance was reported by parties involved in the incident. One individual had already departed the scene, and the other was walking away. There were no reported injuries, and authorities cleared the scene without further incident.
