Here's a look at the notable calls our first responders have been handling over the last few hours. We are monitoring the feeds and will provide a full analytical digest of the day's events later tonight.

🚨 **Suspicious Activity / Vehicle Break-ins** – Pleasure Ln near Leemont Acres – around 3:07 a.m.

Units were dispatched to investigate reports of individuals attempting to break into vehicles in the Leemont Acres area. The suspects, described as four Black males, were seen leaving the vicinity in a silver Toyota Camry, which matched the description from a prior incident. They were believed to be potentially armed and were last observed departing the area.

🚗 **Vehicle Pursuit** – Dixie Hwy and Greenwood Ave – around 3:20 a.m.

A vehicle was observed traveling at a high rate of speed northbound on Dixie Hwy, exhibiting damage to its rear right quarter panel. The car, which had four occupants and dark window tint, was seen passing Bethany and Valley before turning left onto Greenwood Ave. Due to the excessive speed, officers were unable to safely initiate a stop, and the vehicle continued its course.

We will post our full 24-hour summary at the end of the day. Look out for one another. -Derby City Watch.
