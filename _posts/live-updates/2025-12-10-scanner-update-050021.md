Here's a look at the notable calls our first responders have been handling over the last few hours. We are monitoring the feeds and will provide a full analytical digest of the day's events later tonight.

🚨 **Routine Activity** – throughout the early morning hours

Event summary details go here after a blank line. The period has been relatively calm with mostly routine traffic and general chatter among responders. No major incidents or emergencies have been reported during this time. Our teams continue to monitor the situation and remain ready to respond as needed.
