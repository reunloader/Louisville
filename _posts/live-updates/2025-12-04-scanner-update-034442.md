Deputies investigated a vehicle that appeared out of place in the area. The vehicle, a red and gray Ford F-100, was checked, and the registered owner was found to be clear. Further checks on a subject associated with a vehicle near Dr. W.J. Hogg Street and 20th Street also returned clear.

👤 **Welfare Check** – South 38th Street – around 3:36 a.m.

A request was made for officers to check on the well-being of an individual on South 38th Street. The specific circumstances leading to the check and the outcome were not detailed in the initial report.
