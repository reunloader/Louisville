Here's a look at the notable calls our first responders have been handling over the last few hours. We are monitoring the feeds and will provide a full analytical digest of the day's events later tonight.

👤 **Welfare Check** – 6900 block of Arbor Creek Dr – around 4:36 a.m.

A deputy initiated a welfare check on an individual whose license was found to be valid. Dispatch discovered the person was reportedly wanted in Michigan for dangerous drug offenses and requested confirmation. The deputy was authorized to detain the individual pending further verification. Ultimately, the wanted status could not be confirmed, and the individual was not extradited.

We will post our full 24-hour summary at the end of the day. Look out for one another. -Derby City Watch.
