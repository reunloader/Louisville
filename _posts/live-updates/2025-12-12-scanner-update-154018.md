Here's a look at the notable calls our first responders have been handling over the last few hours. We are monitoring the feeds and will provide a full analytical digest of the day's events later tonight.

🚨 **Routine Traffic or Chatter** – local streets and neighborhoods – around 2:00 p.m.

There were no reports of major incidents or emergencies during this time. First responders were actively patrolling and monitoring the area to ensure safety.
