Here's a look at the notable calls our first responders have been handling over the last few hours. We are monitoring the feeds and will provide a full analytical digest of the day's events later tonight.

🏠 **Disturbance** – 800 block of Winkler Ave – around 2:21 a.m.

Police were called to a disturbance involving two females reportedly fighting outside a residence. Several other females were present, with some seen near a white vehicle and others in a silver vehicle. The situation was resolved peacefully as the individuals involved stated they did not require police assistance, appearing to be heavily intoxicated.

⚠️ **Suspicious Vehicle** – 1200 block of Southbrook Street – around 2:21 a.m.

A white Chrysler was observed leaving the vicinity of a reported disturbance. A female was seen interacting with a white vehicle, and two females were in a silver vehicle. It was not immediately clear if these vehicles were connected to the earlier incident. Police units monitored the vehicles, and the outcome of this observation is unclear.

We will post our full 24-hour summary at the end of the day. Look out for one another. -Derby City Watch.
