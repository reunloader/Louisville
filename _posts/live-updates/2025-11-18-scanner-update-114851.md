Here's a look at the notable calls our first responders have been handling over the last few hours. We are monitoring the feeds and will provide a full analytical digest of the day's events later tonight.

🚔 **Traffic Stop** – 1100 block of Bardstown Rd – around 11:12 a.m.

Police initiated a traffic stop after observing a driver with a Kentucky ID card. A check of the driver's record revealed that they did not possess a valid license and had no prior driver history. The stop concluded without further incident.

We will post our full 24-hour summary at the end of the day. Look out for one another. -Derby City Watch.
