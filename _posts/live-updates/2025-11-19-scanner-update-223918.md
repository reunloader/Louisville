Here's a look at the notable calls our first responders have been handling over the last few hours. We are monitoring the feeds and will provide a full analytical digest of the day's events later tonight.

👤 **Welfare Check** – 100 block of [Street Name Unspecified] – around 10:00 p.m.

Police units were dispatched to conduct a welfare check at a residence. Officers arrived and attempted to make contact with the individual inside by knocking on the door, but no one answered. A message was left for the petitioner, and the status of the check remains open as officers continue their efforts.

We will post our full 24-hour summary at the end of the day. Look out for one another. -Derby City Watch.
