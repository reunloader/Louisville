Here's a look at the notable calls our first responders have been handling over the last few hours. We are monitoring the feeds and will provide a full analytical digest of the day's events later tonight.

It's been a relatively quiet period with mostly routine traffic and medical assists.

We will post our full 24-hour summary at the end of the day. Look out for one another. -Derby City Watch.
