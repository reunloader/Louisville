Here's a look at the notable calls our first responders have been handling over the last few hours. We are monitoring the feeds and will provide a full analytical digest of the day's events later tonight.

🏥 **Medical Emergency/Welfare Check** – 1300 block of Clara Ave – around 7:23 a.m.

A call was received reporting a medical emergency with a "major fail" at this location. The dispatcher was given a callback number. The exact outcome of this incident is not clear from the available information as the scanner feed moved to another event.

👤 **Welfare Check/Person Sleeping** – South 4th Street and West Breckenwood Street – around 7:23 a.m.

Emergency services were initially dispatched to a report of a person lying face down, possibly sleeping, in dark clothing and with a blanket. Upon further assessment, it was determined that the individual was simply sleeping. EMS and police units were canceled, and the situation was resolved without further incident.

We will post our full 24-hour summary at the end of the day. Look out for one another. -Derby City Watch.
