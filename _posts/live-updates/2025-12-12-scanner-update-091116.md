🔥 **Electrical Odour Inside a Restaurant** – 1900 block of West Broadway – around 8:30 a.m.

Fire units responded to a report of an electrical odour inside a restaurant. Crews investigated the water heater area and found no visible signs of fire or smoke, but the smell of something burning was present. The situation was contained without further incident, and units returned to service shortly after.
