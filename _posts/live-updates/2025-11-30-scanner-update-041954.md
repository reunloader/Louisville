Here's a look at the notable calls our first responders have been handling over the last few hours. We are monitoring the feeds and will provide a full analytical digest of the day's events later tonight.

🚔 **Traffic Stop** – Preston Hwy and West Indian Trail – around 3:41 a.m.

A traffic stop was conducted on a black Zion vehicle. During the stop, an officer discovered a firearm and an out-of-state identification. The driver presented a Florida ID for an individual who was not a U.S. citizen, along with a Kentucky identification that was not a full driver's license. A check for warrants on the driver came back clear. Another identification, a Venezuelan passport ID, was also processed but did not yield any results. Police units were involved in this routine traffic matter.

We will post our full 24-hour summary at the end of the day. Look out for one another. -Derby City Watch.
