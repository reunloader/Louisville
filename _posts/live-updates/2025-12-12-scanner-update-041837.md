Here's a look at the notable calls our first responders have been handling over the last few hours. We are monitoring the feeds and will provide a full analytical digest of the day's events later tonight.

🔥 **Medical Emergency** – Brown Suburban Hotel, 3300 block of Scarsdale Rd – around 3:35 a.m.

A 44-year-old man was found experiencing chest pain, difficulty breathing, and vomiting. Emergency medical services responded promptly to assist the individual. The patient was stabilized on scene and transported for further care. First responders provided necessary medical aid and ensured the patient's safety.

🚨 **Commercial Burglar Alarm** – Maldon Trace and Crested Towsville Drive and Accomack Dr – around 3:35 a.m.

A commercial alarm was triggered at a shopping center in the area, likely due to a false alarm from the business itself. Police units responded to verify the situation and confirmed that no break-in or unauthorized entry had occurred. The scene was cleared after the alarm was determined to be non-criminal.

🏥 **Medical Emergency** – Maldon Trace and Crested Towsville Drive and Accomack Dr – around 3:40 a.m.

A 45-year-old woman was reported experiencing similar symptoms as the earlier patient, including chest pain, shortness of air, and vomiting. EMS arrived to assist and transported her for further medical evaluation. First responders provided immediate care to ensure her condition was stabilized.

🚗 **Suspicious Vehicle/BOLO** – Lewis and Clark Bridge – around 3:38 a.m.

A FedEx truck was seen driving back and forth in the middle of the bridge, with the driver wearing a ski mask, raising concerns about suspicious activity. The vehicle was preventing passage from Indiana into Kentucky. Units checked with traffic cameras for footage and responded to monitor the situation while investigating the vehicle. No further incidents reported at this time.

It's been a relatively quiet period with mostly routine traffic and medical assists.

We will post our full 24-hour summary at the end of the day. Look out for one another. -Derby City Watch.
