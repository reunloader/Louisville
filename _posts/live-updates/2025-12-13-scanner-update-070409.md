Here's a look at the notable calls our first responders have been handling over the last few hours. We are monitoring the feeds and will provide a full analytical digest of the day's events later tonight.

🔥 **Fire Alarm** – 100 block of Hartwell Ct – around 6:27 a.m.

Responding to a residential fire alarm, units arrived at the scene after a caller reported an audible alarm with no response at the door. No smoke or flames were observed during the initial assessment. The alarm was later confirmed at the 600 block of Hartwell Ct, and the fire units went back in service after ensuring the property was safe. It appears to have been a routine alarm activation with no further issues reported.

We will post our full 24-hour summary at the end of the day. Look out for one another. -Derby City Watch.
