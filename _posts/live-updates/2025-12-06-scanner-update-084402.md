Here's a look at the notable calls our first responders have been handling over the last few hours. We are monitoring the feeds and will provide a full analytical digest of the day's events later tonight.

🦌 **Deer in Roadway** – 500 block of Baker – around 7:42 a.m.

Police officers responded to reports of deer obstructing traffic. Upon arrival, it was confirmed that the majority of the animals had already left the roadway. The reporting officer requested to be cleared from the scene as the hazard was no longer present.

We will post our full 24-hour summary at the end of the day. Look out for one another. -Derby City Watch.
