Here's a look at the notable calls our first responders have been handling over the last few hours. We are monitoring the feeds and will provide a full analytical digest of the day's events later tonight.

🔥 **Fire Alarm** – Ralph Ave near Ferraro Cookies manufacturing facility – around 1:48 a.m.

Responding fire units arrived at the commercial building but found no visible flames or smoke. A similar alarm was reported shortly after at the 2200 block of Ralph Ave, where again no signs of fire or smoke were observed. Both alarms appeared to be false, likely caused by environmental factors, and units confirmed the scene was in service.

🔍 **Suspicious Activity** – near Montana and Euclid, and Forth and Winkler – around 1:55 a.m.

Officers checked nearby camera footage but did not observe any suspicious vehicles or individuals. However, a BOLO was issued for a black Chevrolet Malibu with Indiana plates, possibly driven into the area shortly after the time of the alerts.

🏠 **Domestic Disturbance** – 3400 block of Kathy Dykstra – around 1:55 a.m.

A female caller reported a male subject hitting her and waiting outside her residence. Responding units arrived to assess the situation and ensure safety. Additional welfare checks were conducted at the 200 block of Wood, where officers confirmed the scene and found no immediate danger.

🚓 **Welfare Check and Arrest** – Dixie Hwy near Bernheim Ln – around 1:55 a.m.

A traffic stop was initiated, leading to the detention of a suspect for domestic-related issues. The individual was taken into custody, and the scene was secured.
