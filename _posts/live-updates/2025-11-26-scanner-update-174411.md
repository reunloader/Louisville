Here's a look at the notable calls our first responders have been handling over the last few hours. We are monitoring the feeds and will provide a full analytical digest of the day's events later tonight.

🚔 **Traffic Stop** – East Kentucky and en route to 4900 block of Red Oak Ln – around 5:06 p.m.

Police units conducted a traffic stop on East Kentucky, with officers also responding to the 4900 block of Red Oak Ln. The situation was resolved and cleared.

At the same time, a request was made to update notes on an e-warrant. This required an individual to log out of the system temporarily to allow for the necessary changes.

Additionally, an information request was processed, involving a check with Perry regarding specific folders and the acquisition of a respondent/petitioner number.

It's been a relatively quiet period with mostly routine traffic and medical assists.

We will post our full 24-hour summary at the end of the day. Look out for one another. -Derby City Watch.
