A concerning call was received reporting a female on the line who expressed intent to harm herself, followed by laughter. It was also noted that children's voices could be heard in the background. Due to the nature of the call and the inability to call back the originating phone number, emergency services were dispatched. However, the situation was later resolved, and the response was canceled.
