Here's a look at the notable calls our first responders have been handling over the last few hours. We are monitoring the feeds and will provide a full analytical digest of the day's events later tonight.

🚨 **Shooting Investigation** – North 26th Street and Duncan St – around 2:26 p.m.

Metro units were dispatched to a report of a shooting in the area of North 26th Street and Duncan St. A child had called in, stating they witnessed a shooting at a store via camera. However, the phone's location was pinging to Hoplick Park, leading to confusion. Authorities advised to cancel the initial response to the store, and responding officers were unable to find any victims or evidence of a shooting at either location. The scene was cleared by units.

We will post our full 24-hour summary at the end of the day. Look out for one another. -Derby City Watch.
