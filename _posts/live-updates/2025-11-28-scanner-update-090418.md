Here's a look at the notable calls our first responders have been handling over the last few hours. We are monitoring the feeds and will provide a full analytical digest of the day's events later tonight.

🔥 **Food Fire** – 7900 block of Moss Creek Dr – around 8:26 a.m.

Fire units were dispatched to a residence on Moss Creek Dr following a report of food left unattended on a stove. The residents had already evacuated the apartment safely before emergency services arrived. Upon their assessment, no smoke or flames were visible, leading to the cancellation of the response.

We will post our full 24-hour summary at the end of the day. Look out for one another. -Derby City Watch.
