Here's a look at the notable calls our first responders have been handling over the last few hours. We are monitoring the feeds and will provide a full analytical digest of the day's events later tonight.

🔥 **Structure Fire** – West Broadway near 13th Street – around 5:37 a.m.

Fire units were dispatched to a structure fire where a dormer on the Charlie side was observed to be igniting with a hole above it. Firefighters worked to combat the flames by directing water streams toward the Charlie side over the roofline. Several fire units were involved in the response to bring the situation under control. One unit was cleared from the scene and returned to service after their hose was reloaded.

We will post our full 24-hour summary at the end of the day. Look out for one another. -Derby City Watch.
