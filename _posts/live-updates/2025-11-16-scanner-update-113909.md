Fire units were dispatched to the parking lot of Vaughan Mall following a report of a vehicle fire. Upon arrival, a blue BMW X3 was observed to be nearly completely engulfed in flames. Firefighting crews were able to manage and extinguish the blaze.

🔊 **Fire Alarm** – 2000 block of Newburg Rd – around 11:00 a.m.
