Here's a look at the notable calls our first responders have been handling over the last few hours. We are monitoring the feeds and will provide a full analytical digest of the day's events later tonight.

🔥 **Structure Fire** – 1300 block of Catalpa – around 2:28 a.m.

A significant fire broke out at a three-story brick commercial building on the 1300 block of Catalpa. Heavy flames and smoke were visible on the third floor, prompting a large response from multiple fire units. Crews established a defensive operation, using six hydrants to supply water and prevent the fire from spreading to nearby structures. Traffic control was requested at Woodland and Catalpa due to the incident, and an arson investigator was called to the scene for further examination. The fire was still active at the time, with firefighters working diligently to contain the blaze and ensure safety. The scene was under control with a command post set up, but efforts to fully extinguish the fire and investigate its cause continued.

We will post our full 24-hour summary at the end of the day. Look out for one another. -Derby City Watch.
