**December 07, 2025 - Derby City Watch**

Summary generation failed. Raw bullets:

- **Welfare Check (800 block of Beecher St)** (around 12:19 a.m. p.m. a.m.): A report was made about homeless individuals inside a vacant address. The college indicated that there were curtains up, but no further details were provided about the number of people present. Previous checks by day work were unfounded, but the caller, a neighbor, requested a follow-up to ensure services are available for the individuals. Units were dispatched to check on the situation. - **Disturbance (3100 block of block of Tremont Dr)** (around 12:19 a.m. p.m. a.m.): An anonymous caller reported a loud party at an Airbnb location. The call was made through a tip line, and units were instructed to respond to the scene to address the noise complaint. The situation was noted for follow-up by responding units. - **Routine traffic or chatter.**.
