**December 08, 2025 - Derby City Watch**

Summary generation failed. Raw bullets:

- **Disturbance (7700 block of Carnation Dr) (around 1:11 a.m. a.m. a.m.):** Officers responded to a report of two individuals outside the location yelling and screaming at each other. The caller, who remained anonymous, reported the incident, and units were dispatched to address the situation. - **Shots Fired (7700 block of Kim Dr) (around 1:08 a.m. a.m. a.m.):** An anonymous tip reported hearing seven to eight gunshots in the area. Officers were dispatched to investigate, but no further details or evidence were found at the scene. - **Suspicious Activity (B3 area) (around 1:11 a.m. a.m. a.m.):** Officers reported two male subjects wearing dark clothing who were seen checking car doors and cameras. This incident was noted as being in the same area as the shots fired report. - **Disturbance (12800 block of Charles Farm Cir) (around 1:11 a.m. a.m. a.m.):** Officers responded to a report of a male outside throwing rocks at police units from a parking lot. The individual was described as a middle-aged white male, and it was noted that he had previously been playing loud music. - **Residential Alarm (8000 block of Wolf Pen Branch Rd) (around 1:11 a.m. a.m. a.m.):** A residential alarm was triggered at the basement exit of the property. The alarm company contacted the key holder, who was home but felt uncomfortable checking the alarm themselves, prompting a police response to ensure safety. - **Routine traffic or chatter.**.
