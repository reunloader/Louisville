Here's a look at the notable calls our first responders have been handling over the last few hours. We are monitoring the feeds and will provide a full analytical digest of the day's events later tonight.

👤 **Suspicious Activity / Possible Break-in** – 6900 block of Arbor Creek Dr – around 5:42 a.m.

A concerned resident reported hearing sounds consistent with a break-in at an adjacent abandoned property. The caller, who was understandably panicked, initially described individuals climbing through windows and possibly being armed. Responding police units worked to ensure the caller's safety and assess the situation at the vacant structure.

We will post our full 24-hour summary at the end of the day. Look out for one another. -Derby City Watch.
