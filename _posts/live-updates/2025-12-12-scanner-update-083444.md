Here's a look at the notable calls our first responders have been handling over the last few hours. We are monitoring the feeds and will provide a full analytical digest of the day's events later tonight.

🔥 **Medical Emergency (Male Down)** – intersection of Delta and E W W Market St – around 8:00 a.m.

A male was found unresponsive on the side of an apartment complex on S Campbell St, with a purple cover over his head. Emergency medical services responded promptly to assess and assist the individual. The situation is under observation, and responders are working to determine the cause of the incident.

🏠 **Fire Alarm (Residential)** – 1200 block of Manitow Lane – around 8:00 a.m.

Fire units responded to a residential building after a fire alarm was triggered at this location. Upon arrival, nothing was visible indicating a fire, and the scene was declared in service with no signs of smoke or flames. The alarm was likely a false alert, and no further action was needed.

It's been a relatively quiet period with mostly routine traffic and medical assists.

We will post our full 24-hour summary at the end of the day. Look out for one another. -Derby City Watch.
