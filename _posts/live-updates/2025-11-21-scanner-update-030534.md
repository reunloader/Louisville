👤 **Suspicious Vehicle/Welfare Check** – 1300 block of Miller's Lane – around 2:21 a.m.

A deputy was performing a routine check when they observed a vehicle of interest. A check of the Indiana license plate on a Subaru Legacy revealed it was validly registered. The registration was confirmed to be current until 2026. This incident was determined to be routine.

We will post our full 24-hour summary at the end of the day. Look out for one another. -Derby City Watch.
