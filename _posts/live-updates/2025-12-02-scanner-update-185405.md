Here's a look at the notable calls our first responders have been handling over the last few hours. We are monitoring the feeds and will provide a full analytical digest of the day's events later tonight.

🔥 **Commercial Fire Alarm** – 600 block of E Main St – around 6:02 p.m.

Fire units were dispatched to a commercial building in the 600 block of E Main St following a fire alarm activation. Upon their arrival, it was determined that the alarm had been triggered by cooking within the multi-story structure. The alarm system was subsequently reset, and the responding units were cleared from the scene.

We will post our full 24-hour summary at the end of the day. Look out for one another. -Derby City Watch.
