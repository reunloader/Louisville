Here's a look at the notable calls our first responders have been handling over the last few hours. We are monitoring the feeds and will provide a full analytical digest of the day's events later tonight.

🏥 **Medical Emergency** – 2300 block of Terrier Ct – around 11:00 p.m.

EMS and A Plus 1 were dispatched to a residence where a 57-year-old male was having difficulty breathing and appeared to be turning purple. The individual has a known history of COPD and recently underwent a pacemaker implantation. He was reportedly using his albuterol inhaler prior to the call.

🏥 **Medical Emergency** – 3100 block of Faye Woodway – around 11:00 p.m.

Emergency medical services were called to a home for a 72-year-old female who had sustained significant lacerations to her lower leg. The bleeding was described as serious, and the patient is known to be taking blood-thinning medication, which can complicate hemorrhage control.

We will post our full 24-hour summary at the end of the day. Look out for one another. -Derby City Watch.
