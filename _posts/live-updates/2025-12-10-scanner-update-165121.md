Here's a look at the notable calls our first responders have been handling over the last few hours. We are monitoring the feeds and will provide a full analytical digest of the day's events later tonight.

🚓 **Routine Traffic or Chatter** – local streets and community areas – around 4:00 p.m.

Event summary details go here after a blank line. It has been a quiet period with mostly routine traffic activity and general chatter among responders. No significant incidents or emergencies have been reported during this time. Our teams continue to monitor the situation and remain ready to respond if needed.
