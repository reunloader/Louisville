Here's a look at the notable calls our first responders have been handling over the last few hours. We are monitoring the feeds and will provide a full analytical digest of the day's events later tonight.

🔥 **Automobile Fire** – I-200 block of West at Cane Run – around 9:58 p.m.

A grey Dodge Durango was observed to be smoking heavily from its hood while positioned sideways in the travel lanes. Reports indicated the vehicle had struck both the east and west walls of the roadway. Emergency units were dispatched to the scene. However, the call was subsequently canceled before their arrival.

🔊 **Commercial Alarm** – Meeting St – around 9:57 p.m.

A fire alarm was activated at a single-story restaurant located on Meeting St. Responding units arrived to find no visible signs of fire or smoke and confirmed that no individuals had been evacuated from the establishment. Firefighters worked to locate the source of the alarm, including attempting to find a manual pull station and inspecting the roof, as the system was not resetting. The situation was resolved, and the units cleared the scene.

We will post our full 24-hour summary at the end of the day. Look out for one another. -Derby City Watch.
