Here's a look at the notable calls our first responders have been handling over the last few hours. We are monitoring the feeds and will provide a full analytical digest of the day's events later tonight.

🔥 **Commercial Fire Alarm** – 4900 block of Norton Healthcare Blvd – around 6:46 p.m.

Responders were dispatched to a hospital after a fire alarm was triggered. Upon arrival, fire units and other emergency personnel found no signs of smoke or fire. It was determined that the alarm was caused by overcooked food in a microwave. The scene was cleared by 7:04 p.m., with no injuries reported. This incident appears to be a false alarm with no further danger.

We will post our full 24-hour summary at the end of the day. Look out for one another. -Derby City Watch.
