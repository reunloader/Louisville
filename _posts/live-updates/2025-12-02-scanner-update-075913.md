Here's a look at the notable calls our first responders have been handling over the last few hours. We are monitoring the feeds and will provide a full analytical digest of the day's events later tonight.

🚗 **Stranded Vehicle** – U.S. 22 near North First Born – around 7:21 a.m.

A vehicle was reported to be stranded on U.S. 22 just before North First Born. Emergency units were dispatched to assess the situation and provide assistance. The specific circumstances leading to the vehicle being stranded and the eventual outcome of the incident were not immediately available.
