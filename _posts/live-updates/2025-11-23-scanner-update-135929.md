Here's a look at the notable calls our first responders have been handling over the last few hours. We are monitoring the feeds and will provide a full analytical digest of the day's events later tonight.

👤 **Suspicious Vehicle/Person** – Marshall Road – around 1:08 p.m.

A report came in about a suspicious vehicle and person at a local restaurant on Marshall Road. There was some difficulty communicating due to a language barrier, and another individual had also called about the situation. Responding units spoke with the individuals involved, and they agreed to leave the premises. The situation was resolved without further incident.

We will post our full 24-hour summary at the end of the day. Look out for one another. -Derby City Watch.
