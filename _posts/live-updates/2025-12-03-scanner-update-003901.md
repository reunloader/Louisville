Here's a look at the notable calls our first responders have been handling over the last few hours. We are monitoring the feeds and will provide a full analytical digest of the day's events later tonight.

🚗 **Motor Vehicle Accident with Injury** – I-64 Westbound ramp to I-65 Southbound – around 12:00 a.m.

A young man sustained neck pain following a collision where his vehicle struck a wall on the interstate ramp. Traffic was slowed by a tow truck operator who stopped to assist at the scene. EMS evaluated the individual, who was ultimately able to leave the scene in his own vehicle and was released.

We will post our full 24-hour summary at the end of the day. Look out for one another. -Derby City Watch.
