Here's a look at the notable calls our first responders have been handling over the last few hours. We are monitoring the feeds and will provide a full analytical digest of the day's events later tonight.

👤 **Welfare Check / Medical Emergency** – 4200 block of Simcoe Ln – around 12:57 p.m.

A welfare check was initiated after a concerned individual reported that Joseph Riggle was extremely ill, possibly with the flu. The reporting party communicated with Mr. Riggle by phone, and he agreed to meet them on his back porch to receive some papers. The reporting party indicated they would not make direct contact but would deliver the requested items. Police units were dispatched to the scene to ensure the situation was handled appropriately.

We will post our full 24-hour summary at the end of the day. Look out for one another. -Derby City Watch.
