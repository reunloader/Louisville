Here's a look at the notable calls our first responders have been handling over the last few hours. We are monitoring the feeds and will provide a full analytical digest of the day's events later tonight.

🏥 **Medical Emergency** – 600 block of South 4th Street – around 10:30 p.m.

Units were dispatched to a report of a medical emergency involving a young child. The initial call indicated a possible gunshot wound to the leg for a 4-year-old male. However, upon arrival, responders determined the child was experiencing rib pain and shortness of breath, and there was no evidence of a gunshot wound. EMS and police units were on scene to provide care and assess the situation.

🔥 **Commercial Fire Alarm** – 300 block of Joe Conway Cir – around 10:30 p.m.

Fire units were sent to the Masonic Homes Pump House following a report of a commercial fire alarm. The alarm was specifically noted as a general fire alarm originating from Zone E. Responders arrived and found no visible signs of fire. It was determined that the alarm was caused by a mechanical issue, and while the audible alarm had ceased, a strobe light was still flashing.

We will post our full 24-hour summary at the end of the day. Look out for one another. -Derby City Watch.
