🚔 **Traffic Stop/Vehicle Inquiry** – Taylorsville Rd and I-200 block – around 2:16 a.m.

During the early morning hours, a check was conducted to determine if the registered owner of a vehicle was the individual driving it. The outcome of this inquiry was negative, suggesting a potential issue with the vehicle or its operator. This likely ties into the traffic advisory issued for the same vicinity.
