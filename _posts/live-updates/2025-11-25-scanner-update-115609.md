Here's a look at the notable calls our first responders have been handling over the last few hours. We are monitoring the feeds and will provide a full analytical digest of the day's events later tonight.

🔥 **Medical Emergency / Gas Leak** – Preston Hwy and West Broadway – around 11:28 a.m.

Emergency services were dispatched to a medical situation near the intersection of West Broadway and South 28th Street. Shortly thereafter, units responded to a report of a gas leak with associated illness at a PNC bank located in the 3000 block of Preston Hwy. Several individuals inside the bank reported experiencing dizziness and a strong smell of natural gas. The source of the odor was eventually traced to an external location. Although some individuals complained of headaches and dizziness, they did not require further medical attention from EMS. A separate medical call was also addressed in the 700 block of W Jefferson St.

👤 **Suspicious Activity / Welfare Check** – Jefferson St and Dixie Garden Dr – around 11:16 a.m.

Authorities were engaged in checking on the well-being of an individual in the 700 block of Jefferson St, which may have involved a welfare check or investigating suspicious activity. Additionally, officers were informed of a pending call for service related to a disturbance or suspicious circumstances in the same area. A separate incident, possibly a traffic stop or other police matter, was reported in the 2000 block of Dixie Garden Dr.

We will post our full 24-hour summary at the end of the day. Look out for one another. -Derby City Watch.
