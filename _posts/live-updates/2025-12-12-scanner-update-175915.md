Here's a look at the notable calls our first responders have been handling over the last few hours. We are monitoring the feeds and will provide a full analytical digest of the day's events later tonight.

🔥 **Water Leak** – outside Audubon Plaza Dr near Audubon Hospital – around 5:32 p.m.

Fire units responded to a report of a water leak outside the hospital area, possibly indicating a water main break. Crews assessed the situation to determine the extent of the leak and ensure safety in the vicinity.

🏥 **Medical Emergency** – Sacred Heart Village on Payne St – around 5:32 p.m.

Emergency medical services assisted a 175-year-old female experiencing chest pain and nausea, likely related to a tumor. She has a history of stroke and was engaged in studying earlier. EMS arrived promptly to provide care and transport if needed.

It's been a relatively quiet period with mostly routine traffic and medical assists.

We will post our full 24-hour summary at the end of the day. Look out for one another. -Derby City Watch.
