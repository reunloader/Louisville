Here's a look at the notable calls our first responders have been handling over the last few hours. We are monitoring the feeds and will provide a full analytical digest of the day's events later tonight.

🔥 **Commercial Fire Alarm** – 4200 block of Hazelwood Ave near Bluegrass and Olma – around 12:14 p.m.

Responding to a commercial alarm, fire units arrived to find the building evacuated with no signs of fire or smoke. The alarm was likely a false trigger, and crews checked the premises thoroughly before clearing the scene. No injuries or damages were reported. The situation was resolved without further incident, and the scene was cleared shortly after response.

We will post our full 24-hour summary at the end of the day. Look out for one another. -Derby City Watch.
