Here's a look at the notable calls our first responders have been handling over the last few hours. We are monitoring the feeds and will provide a full analytical digest of the day's events later tonight.

🏥 **Medical Assist/Animal Rescue** – 800 block of Baker – around 12:12 p.m.

A young caller reported a distressing situation involving her cat, whose paws had become trapped in a window. The caller also indicated she had sustained a hand injury. EMS was dispatched to provide assistance with the situation.

🔊 **Alarm Activation** – 800 block of Baker – around 12:12 p.m.

Following the initial report of a trapped animal and injury, the incident was later determined to be a false alarm. It appears the caller may have inadvertently triggered the alarm system during the stressful event.

A concerned citizen observed suspicious behavior on surveillance cameras, noting an individual attempting to open car doors in a parking lot.
