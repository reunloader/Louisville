A vehicle was observed stopped in the middle of the street, with a male occupant exiting and approaching the building before returning to the front. Responding officers noted that the individual may have been experiencing a mental health crisis. The exact nature of the activity remains unclear.

👤 **Welfare Check** – 2300 block of East Kentucky – around 1:48 a.m.

A call was received from a Spanish-speaking female who was speaking to someone in the background and did not respond to the call-taker's questions.
