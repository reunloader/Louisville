Here's a look at the notable calls our first responders have been handling over the last few hours. We are monitoring the feeds and will provide a full analytical digest of the day's events later tonight.

🏥 **Medical Emergency** – Downtown Area – around 2:01 p.m.

First responders were dispatched to a medical emergency in the downtown area. After assessing the situation, the initial call was cleared. Instructions were given to remain available in case a second shift needed to make contact with the individual. The units were then cleared from the call.

We will post our full 24-hour summary at the end of the day. Look out for one another. -Derby City Watch.
