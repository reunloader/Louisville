Here's a look at the notable calls our first responders have been handling over the last few hours. We are monitoring the feeds and will provide a full analytical digest of the day's events later tonight.

🏥 **Medical Emergency** – 4000 block of Shady Villa Dr – around 2:03 p.m.

A 39-year-old female accidentally ingested the wrong pills, leading to symptoms such as abnormal breathing, neck pain, dry mouth, and shortness of air. Medical units were dispatched to the scene to assess the situation. Fortunately, the call was later canceled as the situation was resolved before their arrival.

🏥 **Medical Emergency** – 3400 block of Cathy Daschick Way – around 2:31 p.m.

A 51-year-old male was reported to be having a seizure. This individual has a history of epilepsy and diabetes, which prompted a swift response from medical units to provide necessary assistance. The situation is being monitored closely by the responding personnel.

We will post our full 24-hour summary at the end of the day. Look out for one another. -Derby City Watch.
