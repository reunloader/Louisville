Here's a look at the notable calls our first responders have been handling over the last few hours. We are monitoring the feeds and will provide a full analytical digest of the day's events later tonight.

👤 **Welfare Check / Eviction** – Oak Village Dr – around 1:51 p.m.

Deputies were dispatched to Oak Village Dr to conduct a welfare check related to an eviction. Initially, the resident could not be seen through the windows due to the blinds being drawn. Officers intended to open the blinds to establish communication with the individual. Several units, including 13-35, 83, 113, 155, 23-02, and 114, were involved in the response. The situation was updated with contact information for the resident.

We will post our full 24-hour summary at the end of the day. Look out for one another. -Derby City Watch.
