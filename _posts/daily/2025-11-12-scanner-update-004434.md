**🚔 Derby City Watch: Morning Update – November 11, 2025**

Here's a look at the notable calls our first responders have been handling over the last few hours. We are monitoring the feeds and will provide a full analytical digest of the day's events later tonight.

🏥 **Medical Emergency** – Murray Star Hill Dr Bardstown Rd – around 12:08 a.m.
Emergency medical services responded to a call for a 47-year-old female who had been bitten by a dog and was found unresponsive. Fire Engine 20 was initially dispatched to the scene but was subsequently canceled by EMS once they arrived and assessed the situation.

It's been a relatively quiet period with mostly routine traffic and medical assists.

We will post our full 24-hour summary at the end of the day. Look out for one another. -Derby City Watch.
