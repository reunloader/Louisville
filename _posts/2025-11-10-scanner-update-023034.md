**Derby City Watch: Morning Update**

Here’s a look at the notable calls our first responders have been handling over the last few hours. We are monitoring the feeds and will provide a full analytical digest of the day's events later tonight.

🚨 **Medical Assist** – Valley Area 1:45 a.m.AM
A call came in reporting a 65-year-old female experiencing what appeared to be stroke symptoms. An ambulance was initially sent to the scene to provide assistance. However, after further assessment, the ambulance was no longer needed and was cancelled. The well-being of the individual is our primary concern.

We will post our full 24-hour summary at the end of the day. Look out for one another. -Derby City Watch.
